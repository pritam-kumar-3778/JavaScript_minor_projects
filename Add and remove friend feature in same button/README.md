1 : Add and Remove friend feature in same button

In HTML page :
- simply I create a div with id card for creating a card with some styling proporty.
- After that I add an image inside card and give some styling for better look.
- After that I create a h1 tag and put the name 
- After that I create a h5 tag for showing the status
- After that I create a button named as 'Add Feiend' .


Functionality : 
- When click on the 'Add Friend' button It shows a message for friendship and at that time the text of button 
  change to 'Remove Friend' and when click on that button It shows an anather message.
- I use document.querySeector for get the element.
- then use addEventListener for change functionality 
- Add some styling proporty also
